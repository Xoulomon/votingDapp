            A voting Dapp will enable us to streamline and democratize our
            decision-making processes, ensuring that every member can actively

            At VoteBlock, we believe in the power of collective decision-making.
            That's why we're excited to announce the launch of VoteBlock, our
            innovative decentralized application (dapp) designed to
            revolutionize how we allocate event resources. With VoteBlock, every
            member of our community has a voice in determining the direction of
            our organization.

            Our voting dapp allows members to participate in important decisions
            regarding the allocation of event resources. We understand the
            significance of grants, donations, and investment funds in driving
            our organization forward. Through VoteBlock, members can cast their
            votes on two crucial proposals: Research Projects and Operational
            Expenses.
